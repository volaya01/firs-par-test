#TITOAnimals
This project was created with the Framework Vue.js
## Instructions to install the local project

### Project structure
This project contains two main folders, but the content of the application is in the folder
'src'.

Folders of src:

api: Requests of animal and branch

modules: getters and setters of animal, branch and user

router: Routes of all views

store: This is vuex. It serves as a centralized store for all the components

the file 'event-bus.js' helped me to join the search and order filters in the main view 'Home'
###Users 
In the 'config.js' file you find the created users, 
each one has different permissions in the aplication but not all work :(
